    <h2> Youth Foster Care in Texas </h2>
    <p> In January 2019, there were 29,927 children in foster care within Texas and 3,378 children waiting for adoptive families. New federal child abuse and neglect data shows an increase in the number of victims who suffered maltreatment for the first time since 2015. As in past years, rates of abuse and neglect are highest among infants and young children.

    <h2> Youth Foster Care in the United States </h2>
    <p> According to the most recent federal data, there are currently more than 400,000 children in foster care in the United States. They range in age from infants to 21 years old (in only a select number of states). Each year, as many as 20,000 youth age out of foster care without a permanent family or home.

    <h2> Youth Abuse in Foster Care </h2>
    <p> New federal child abuse and neglect data shows an increase in the number of victims who suffered maltreatment for the first time since 2015. America  loses on average between four and seven children every day to child abuse. Many who remain victims, are eventually transferred to our foster care system where these problems are unlikely to be seriously addressed.

    <h2> Mental Health in Foster Care </h2>
    <p> Children in foster care are more likely to have experienced abuse, neglect, or some type of family trauma. Nearly 80% of children in foster care ages 2 to 14 were diagnosed with a clinically significant mental health issues. Being able to provide mental health services or volunteering to become a mentor to this population is quite possibly one of the most obvious steps in improving the lives of foster youth.
