 <h4> Kate Irlene is a foster mom of 4 years and has made 4 adoptions of her own. </h4>

 <p> She adopted her eldest daughter, Akra, at 17 years old. For youth age 9 and older, the likelihood of being adopted drops significantly, but this is not due to the myth that would'nt like to be adopted. In fact, the vast majority of older adoptive children express a strong desire of a family to belong to, but some older foster youth have a difficult time trusting adults due to past experiences and feel ambiguous about adoption.</p>

 <p> For Akra and her mother Kate, there is no regret in their decision. After over 10 years years in foster care, Akyra was finally adopted into a loving home. On the other end, far too many youth, age out of foster care resulting in homelessness, work instability, and a loss for loving relationships with adults. These facts become even more heartbreaking because we know these youth could have found a permanent family, if only they had been given the chance. </p>
